## Project name: Weather Report

This project has been developed as a part of learning how to develope website using some of the technologies that I know. The web app has been designed to render weather report of any city that has the record with 'Open Weather Map' `https://openweathermap.org/`. I was able to access the API data by achieving an API key.

### User story

* User can access the crrent weather data of a city by entering the city name in the input box. 
* It will display an error message if the input box is empty.
* Currently 10 different types of data are made available including an image-icon that reflects sky condition of the city.
* A reset button placed next to submit button will refresh the window to start as new.

### Chalenges

* Writing jQuery function. 
* Function AJAX get method using the url.

### Future feature

This web app may be made to show data in different measurement system such as Imperial, Metric, and Absolute. Hence by assigning one of the systems as default it can show the data in other systems by using button/s and jQuery fuction/s with toggle event function.

### Technologies used

* HTML
* CSS and Bootstrap library
* javaScript and jQuery library
* Weather data in json format
* AJAX get() method
